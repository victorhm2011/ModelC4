**Problem**
A big problem that we have at the moment of see what time is convenient for me is that we
had to go to the airport and see the schedules.

**Solution**
The solution that I propose is that we have to create a Internet Schedule System where users 
can make his operations interacting with the Web Aplication(UI), and the web Aplication 
will send the data and request the information to the database using an Api for interprete 
his calls and request, I dessign the API aplication using a monholitic structure called 
Layer Model, where I have 3 capes, The Presentation Layer(Controller), 
business logic layer(Services and models) and Data Access Layer(Repository and Entities).
